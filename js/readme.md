Triway Transportation LLC Project

Welcome to the Triway Transportation web app! It helps drivers and managers easily handle tasks like load assignments, schedules, and driver statuses, making operations smoother.

The app has three pages: a home page, a driver portal, and a manager portal. The home page provides company info and a login form. Drivers can view their loads, schedules, and update their status in the driver portal. Managers can assign loads and see driver statuses in the manager portal.

To get started, open the index.html file. From there, explore the driver and manager portals via links on the home page.

The app uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with the FullCalendar library for an easy-to-read driver schedule.

This simple tool can be expanded in the future with real-time updates, data storage, and advanced scheduling features.
